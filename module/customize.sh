    Disclaimer & Warning:
    
    FAS-RS currently injects the game via Zygisk,
    intercepting libgui's function calls to get
    frame rendering time.
    
    However, this may also causes root detection
    or injection detection of the target game
    to be triggered.
    
    So when this happens,
    YOU SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY YOURSELF.
    
    At the same time, I guarantee that fas-rs' s
    zygisk injection is only for the sole purpose
    of fetching frametime for frame-aware scheduling.
    This project will always be open source,
    and anyone can review it to confirm that
    there is indeed no malicious code in it.
